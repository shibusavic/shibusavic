# ShibusaVic

"Shibusa" is a derivative of [Shibui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui), a reference to "simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty," and relates to an LLC I own for corp-to-corp contract work.

I'm currently employed in the health care space, working with PDF documents and healthcare-related data transfers/transactions.

My most recent contribution to the world is a [C# SDK for eodhistoricaldata.com](https://github.com/shibusavic/StockDataImport); and a CLI import tool with a postgreSQL db structure that (mostly) corresponds to the [EodHistoricalData.Com API](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/). I haven't done the 1.0 release just yet, but I've been using it frequently for several weeks and I think it's stable.

The [shibusa-common](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-common), [SqlExplorer](https://github.com/shibusavic/SqlExplorer), and [shibusa-devtools](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-devtools) repos contain collections of C# utilities I've built more than once in my career. In general, these tools are designed to make my life easier. Contributions are welcome; pilfer as necessary.

Be well.
