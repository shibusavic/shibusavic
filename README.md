# ShibusaVic

"Shibusa" is a derivative of [Shibui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui), a reference to "simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty," and relates to an LLC I own for corp-to-corp contract work.

The [shibusa-common](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-common), [SqlExplorer](https://github.com/shibusavic/SqlExplorer), and [shibusa-devtools](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-devtools) repos contain collections of C# utilities I've built more than once in my career. In general, these tools are designed to make my life easier. Contributions are welcome; pilfer as necessary.

I am currently working on [an SDK for eodhistoricaldata.com](https://github.com/shibusavic/EodHistoricalDataCSharpSdk). I've got the API shelled out; next step is a CLI import tool.

--------

Be well.
