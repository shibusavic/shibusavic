# ShibusaVic

"Shibusa" is a derivative of [Shibui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui), a reference to "simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty."

The [shibusa-common](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-common), [SqlExplorer](https://github.com/shibusavic/SqlExplorer), and [shibusa-devtools](https://github.com/shibusavic/shibusa-devtools) repos contain collections of C# utilities I've built more than once in my career. In general, these tools are designed to make my life easier. You might discover something interesting: recursive text transformations, useful extensions, US Calendar date calculations, or a tool for parsing a database schema and telling you in what order tables need to be deleted. Contributions are welcome; pilfer as necessary.

I am currently working on [an SDK for eodhistoricaldata.com](https://github.com/shibusavic/EodHistoricalDataCSharpSdk). Work has been slower than I would have liked because my day job has been demanding lately. But, I hope to have the project wrapped up soon - it's a small part of a bigger project I've been working on since February 2020 - more on that later - maybe.

--------

Be well.

Vic
