# ShibusaVic

Hi, my name is Victor, or Vic if you prefer, and this is my profile for my **Shibusa, LLC** repository.

"Shibusa" is a derivative of [Shibui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui), a reference to "simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty." Shibusa, LLC is a company registered in the State of Iowa. No web site yet - it's a low priority right now.

The [Shibusa.Common](https://github.com/shibusavic/Shibusa.Common) repo contains a variety of functions and utilities that I've built repeatedly over the years. Every iteration makes them better. You will find a number of useful tools in there, including text transformations, common math solutions, and a CLI that uses regular expressions to find content within files (and yes, I know that grep already exists).

The [SqlExplorer](https://github.com/shibusavic/SqlExplorer) repo contains a CLI utility that reads an MS SQL Server database and extracts out the schema into CSV files.

The [Markdown-TOC](https://github.com/shibusavic/Markdown-TOC) repo contains a CLI utility that can create a Table of Contents (TOC) of internal links within a markdown file or create a TOC file that contains external links within a specified directory.

Iâ€™m currently working on a project revolving around the quantification of stock market psychology. It's called _Kyna_, and it's in a private repository.

--------

That's all for now. Be well.

Vic

Founder, Shibusa LLC
